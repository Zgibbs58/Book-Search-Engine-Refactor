# Book Search Engine Refactor

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
This is a refactor of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The application is designed for readers who want to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. It utilizes the MERN stack, consisting of a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can search for books, sign up or log in to save books to their account, and view their saved books.
